		<p style="line-height:2.0; display:none"><a href="/">Isabella Hochschild</a> grew up in San Francisco with her mother, grandmother, and a rotation of pets. She attended a bilingual elementary school where 75% of her classes were in French. This helped to cultivate her love for travel. She switched to a different high school but her love of languages persisted, and she has continued to study French and Spanish. Although he currently lives in Malaysia, Isabella's father is Australian, and she have been lucky enough to be able to visit him there a couple of times. She hope to one day be able to explore more of the US and the world, including South Africa, where one of her grandparents was born. Outside of school, her hobbies include sports, baking, and coding. Isabella is a black belt in tae kwon do and has played volleyball, soccer, and basketball from a young age. In the first soccer game she played with her club team in 8th grade, she was injured, and after a long process she was finally diagnosed with CRPS, a form of chronic pain. Thankfully, the illness has mostly gone away and she has been able to return to sports in high school. She discovered a love of running, so now along with playing soccer in the winter, she does cross country and track. She loves to read and helps out at her aunt’s bookstore as often as she can, restocking books or writing reviews. Isabella won the President’s Award for Educational Excellence for her middle school in 2017 and a North Coast Section Athletics Award for Academic Excellence in 9th grade.</p>
